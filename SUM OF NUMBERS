TEST CASE 1:
package example1;
public class SUMOFNUMBERS {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1;i<=100; i++) {
			sum +=i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: " + sum);
		}
}

OUTPUT:
Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: 5050

TEST CASE 2:
package example1;
public class SUMOFNUMBERS {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1;i<=50; i++) {
			sum +=i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: " + sum);
     }
}

OUTPUT:
Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275

TEST CASE 3:
package example1;
public class SUMOFNUMBERS {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1;i<=10; i++) {
			sum +=i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: " + sum);
     }
}
OUTPUT:
Sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55

TEST CASE 4:
package example1;
public class SUMOFNUMBERS {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 50;i<=100; i++) {
			sum +=i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum of numbers from 50 to 100 is: " + sum);
     }
}
OUTPUT:
Sum of numbers from 50 to 100 is: 3825

TEST CASE 5:
package example1;
public class SUMOFNUMBERS {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1;i<=1; i++) {
			sum +=i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is: " + sum);
     }
}
OUTPUT:
Sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is: 1

RESULT:
Displays the correct sum as from 1 to 100 is 5050
Display the correct sum as from 1 to 50 is 1275
Display the correct sum as from 1 to 10 is 55
Display the correct sum as from 50 to 100 is 3825
Display the correct sum as from 1 to 1 is 1
